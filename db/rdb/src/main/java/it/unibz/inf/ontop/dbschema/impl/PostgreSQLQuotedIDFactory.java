/**
 * Creates QuotedIdentifiers following the rules of PostrgeSQL:<br>
 *    - unquoted identifiers are converted into lower case<br>

 * ----------
 *
 * http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html
 *
 * Unquoted names are always folded to lower (!) case.
 *
 * Quoted identifier is formed by enclosing an arbitrary sequence of characters in double-quotes (").
 * (To include a double quote, write two double quotes.)
 *
 * A variant of quoted identifiers allows including escaped Unicode characters identified by their code points.
 * This variant starts with U& (upper or lower case U followed by ampersand) immediately before the opening
 * double quote, without any spaces in between, for example U&"foo".

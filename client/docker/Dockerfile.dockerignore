# NOTE: In principle we may include everything because we use a multi-stage Docker build where the
# context is copied only in the 'compile' stage and does not affect the final image size (where
# only binaries generated in the 'compile' phase are copied). Still, to speed up the build process
# by reducing the context size, we exclude the largest directories not required for building Ontop.
# (as a result, the transfered context is around 75M)

# Exclude .git history
.git

# Eclude .cache directories
# (this comes from /test/lightweight-tests/lightweight-db-test-images/.dockerignore)
**/.cache

# Exclude test data (we are not testing when compiling, this can be done outside the Docker build)
test/*/src

# Exclude Maven generated files, except for directory /build/distribution/target/ontop-docker from
# where pre-built binaries are imported when using Docker build option '--target image-from-binaries'
**/target
!/build/distribution/target/ontop-docker

# Exclude the Dockerfile, this file, and the build-image.sh script, for convenience when working on
# them (as changing them will not invalidate Docker cache and trigger a Maven build)
client/docker/Dockerfile
client/docker/Dockerfile.dockerignore
client/docker/build-image.sh

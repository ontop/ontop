/***
 * An emptyness index is an utility that helps two components comunicate about
 * the status of the data returned by a query. The purpose of the index is for
 * the client to be able to ask the index if a rule is known NOT to have any
 * data.
 * <p>
 * The emptyness index is directly used by the unfolder datalog unfolder to
 * avoid unfolding with respect to rules that will not generate any data anyway,
 * since their body is always empty.
 * <p>
 * Emptyness checking is specially critical for the sematnic index mappings. The
 * Semantic Index repository generates many mappings. E.g. for each class C
 * defined in hte vocabulary, it generates at leaste two mappings, one to be
 * able to retrieve Abox assertions (triples) of the form C(\<a\>) and another
 * one to be able to retrieve assertions of the form C(_:bnode1), since the
 * repository stores this data diferently. Same happens with data and object
 * property mappings.
 * <p>
 * However, at the same time the SI repository keeps track of the data that has
 * been inserted into the repo. Most of the mappings will not have data, so it
 * is possible to avoid using all the mappings by asking the repo. This is done
 * through this interface.

	 * Asks if the mapping for Predicate p, with arity types.size() is empty.
	 * The mapping must match the type of each of the empty components. For
	 * example. A query of the form isEmpty("Person", COL_TYPE.BNODE) returns
	 * empty if the mapping with head Person(BNODE(x)) is empty.
	 *

	 * This should not be used for mapping of the for triple(x,y,z) see next

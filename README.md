Ontop
=====

Ontop is a Virtual Knowledge Graph system.
It exposes the content of arbitrary relational databases as knowledge graphs. These graphs are virtual, which means that data remains in the data sources instead of being moved to another database.

Ontop translates [SPARQLÂ queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) expressed over the knowledge graphs into SQL queries executed by the relational data sources. It relies on [R2RML mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/) and can take advantage of lightweight ontologies.

Compiling, packing, testing, etc.
--------------------

The project is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project. Compiling,
running the unit tests, building the release binaries all can be done
using Maven.  Currently, we use Maven 3.6+ and Java 11 to build the
project.

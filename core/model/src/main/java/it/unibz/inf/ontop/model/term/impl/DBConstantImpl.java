     * This method directly refers to the notion of strict-equality.
     * Is under 2VL and treats the NULLs of strict-equalities as false.
     *
     * For DBConstants, term types are NOT CONSIDERED for this test. Only the lexical string matters.
     *
     * This tolerance initially comes from the fact that DBs like PostgreSQL offer almost-identical datatypes
     * such as SERIAL and INT4 over which one would like to join and over which foreign keys may hold.
     * For the sake of simplicity, Ontop treats these types as equivalent in strict-equality,
     * which enables FK-based optimization to be applied. Observes that the tiny technical difference between
     * SERIAL and INT4 is irrelevant for the scope of Ontop.
     *
     * Also observe that users CANNOT specify directly a strict-equality over DB terms.
     * Equalities in the user-provided mapping are first treated as "not yet typed" and are later transformed based
     * on their types. And for what regards SPARQL, it deals with RDF terms, not DB terms. This means
     * that strict-equalities between DB terms are produced internally, in situations where Ontop should be able to use
     * them in a meaningful manner.
